Optimization: Find the most time consuming parts and find a way to optimize them
Find a way to calculate the best clone_number and trainingImagesNumber values for the fastest NN learning
Efficiency: Make the NN more efficient by changing the algorithm
Make possible several mutations at once

Prevent same 1-mutation clones, especially for removing synapses and neurons
Create all possible 1 mutation clones with removed synapses and neurons beforehand
Calculate the number of clones depending on all possible 1-mutations
Every generation make one completely random clone to be able to start from a random point on the cost function graph and to avoid the limit of mutations a clone can have
